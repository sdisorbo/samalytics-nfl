          Every matchup by week — step forward or back through the schedule. Each game shows each
          team&apos;s Elo-based win probability and how much Elo they&apos;d gain on a win or lose on a
          loss. Upcoming games use each team&apos;s preseason-projected Elo and update as the season plays out.
